## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational book project. Created 80+ tasks organized across 9 phases, with priority-ordered user stories (P1-P3). Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers, and story labels. The task breakdown covers all required modules, weeks, content types, and quality validation steps.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with 80+ specific tasks organized by user story priority for the AI/Humanoid Robotics book project
- 🧪 Tests: Task validation completed with proper checklist format adherence
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md in specs/001-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to begin implementation with individual tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The task breakdown provides clear, actionable steps for implementing the Docusaurus-based educational book with proper dependencies and parallelization opportunities.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
