# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This educational book is designed for graduate students, AI/Robotics enthusiasts, and technical educators who want to understand the principles and applications of embodied intelligence in humanoid robotic systems.

## Course Overview

This book is structured into four main modules that progressively build your understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of Robot Operating System 2, the backbone of most robotic applications
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation and virtual environments for robot development
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Discover AI perception, reinforcement learning, and sim-to-real transfer
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Understand multimodal interaction and cognitive planning

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Simulate robotic behaviors in Gazebo and Unity environments
- Apply AI techniques for perception and control in robotics
- Integrate vision, language, and action for multimodal robot interaction
- Implement practical robotic applications on various hardware platforms

## Prerequisites

This course assumes familiarity with:

- Basic programming concepts (preferably Python)
- Linear algebra and calculus fundamentals
- Basic understanding of physics and mechanics
- Some exposure to machine learning concepts

## Hardware Tiers

The practical exercises in this book are designed to accommodate different budget constraints:

- **Budget Tier**: Single-board computers and basic sensors
- **Mini-Humanoid Tier**: Specialized humanoid robot kits
- **Premium Tier**: Full humanoid robots and professional-grade sensors

## Simulation Environments

We'll be using multiple simulation environments to provide comprehensive learning experiences:

- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** (LTS version) for robot control and communication
- **Gazebo** for physics simulation and sensor modeling
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for advanced AI and perception tasks
- **Unity** for visualization and human-robot interaction

Let's begin this exciting journey into the world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
